# 👋 Hi, I’m Martin Murithi.

I am a learner of the ALX FrontEnd Pro programme and I want to revamp my GitHub Profile to make it stand out from the crowd in my job search.  

This is why I started with software engineering, what I am passionate about and what inspires me:  
👉 "To create modern websites to help small scale retailers reach a larger market pool".

My aim is to be an expert in FrontEnd web development and that’s why I would like to work on many projects that will propell me to reach there.
